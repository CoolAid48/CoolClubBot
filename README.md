# CoolClubBot

Welcome to my brainchild! I made a basic Discord Bot for my Community Discord Server using node.js! Thanks to Under Ctrl, MrJAwesome, and others for the basic tutorials... and ChatGPT   =D


> CoolClubBot, or just CCB for short, is a Discord chat bot built by CoolAid from the ground-up. Built with javascript, CoolClubBot can do anything MEE6 could do, from welcoming new members to replying to commands, all personalized for our little community! CoolClubBot is also a Twitch chatbot, works via Streamer.bot and can do everything (and more). You can find a public repository for the discord.js build of CCB here on GitHub
